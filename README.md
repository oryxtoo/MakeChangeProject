## MakeChange

### Intro
This is my first project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp.

This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked for an item amount.
The user enters the amount.

Then the user is asked for an amount tendered, enters the amount, and is given change in the largest denominations possible.

This project was assigned after Week 1 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding School.
