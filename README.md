## MakeChange

### Intro
This is my first project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp.

This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked for an item amount.

The user enters the amount.

Then the user is asked for an amount tendered, enters the amount, and is given change in the largest denominations possible.

This project was assigned after Week 1 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding School.
------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented if statements to check for "no change returned", request user input for continuing the program and code that checks for incorrect input. Also wrote code to keep track of the amount paid until the user gives enough money.
------------------------------------------------------------
### Technologies Used
* Java
* Java operators, especially %
------------------------------------------------------------
### Lessons Learned
That I suck at making change. Okay, not really.

The calculations for the change were interesting and challenging when I initially wrote the program. Looking back, MakeChange is pretty straight-forward. I can see that, even though it is simplistic, it can be applied to different scenarios. Very useful.
